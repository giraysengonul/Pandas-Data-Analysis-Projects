# 🎬 Movie Genre Data Analysis

This project explores in-depth patterns and insights related to **movie genres** using Python and Pandas. The goal is to uncover how genres influence factors like revenue, budget, popularity, and overall success of a movie.

## 📌 Introduction

In this analysis, we focus specifically on **genres**. We aim to answer key questions and test specific hypotheses using a real-world dataset of movies.

---

## ❓ Research Questions (Q)

- Which genres are the most common (i.e., most movies made)?
- Which genres have the highest average budget and revenue?
- Which genres have the highest average profit?
- Which genres are the most popular on average?
- Which genres have the most movies with a voting average ≥ 8?

---

## 🧪 Research Hypotheses (H)

- 🎥 The best movies according to **vote average** return high profit and revenue.
- 🌟 The best movies according to **popularity** return high profit and revenue.
- 💰 Highly budgeted movies tend to return high revenue and profit.
- 🎯 Highly budgeted movies are also more **popular**.

---

## 🔍 Key Focus Areas

- Yearly trends of profitability per genre
- Distribution of genres across time
- Correlation between genre and success metrics (budget, revenue, popularity, ratings)

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualizations
- Jupyter Notebook for analysis
- Dataset: TMDb (The Movie Database)

---

## 📈 Sample Visualizations

> Add sample charts like bar plots for genre popularity, revenue trends, etc.

```python
# Example Python snippet
profit = df['revenue'] - df['budget']
