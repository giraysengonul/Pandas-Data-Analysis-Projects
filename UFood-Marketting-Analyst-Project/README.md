This project presents an end-to-end analysis of a simulated dataset from **UFood**, the leading food delivery platform in Brazil. The objective is to generate valuable business insights, understand customer behavior, and propose data-driven actions that optimize marketing campaign performance.

## 🧠 Business Context

UFood is present in over 1,000 cities in Brazil and serves nearly one million consumers annually. The company offers a wide range of premium and regular products in five categories:

- 🍷 Wines  
- 🥩 Rare Meat Products  
- 🍍 Exotic Fruits  
- 🐟 Specially Prepared Fish  
- 🍰 Sweet Products

Customers purchase through three main sales channels:
- Physical Stores  
- Catalogs  
- Website  

Despite strong historical revenues, the company faces uncertain profit growth over the next three years. The **marketing department** is under pressure to optimize its annual budget and demonstrate the impact of its campaigns on business success.

## 🧩 Customer Segmentation Approach

Clustering techniques such as **K-Means**, **Hierarchical Clustering**, and **PCA** were tested to identify meaningful groups of customers based on:

- Spending behavior  
- Product preferences  
- Response to past campaigns  
- Channel usage  

The final segmentation model enables more **targeted and cost-effective** campaign strategies.

---

## 📈 Insights & Recommendations

- High-income, website-active customers were **more responsive** to campaigns involving premium products.  
- Catalog-based buyers showed **low engagement**, suggesting potential cost-saving if deprioritized.  
- Younger customers (<30) showed higher responsiveness to **exotic fruits** and **sweet products** campaigns.  
- A/B test proposal: Compare gold vs regular product focus in upcoming campaigns for each segment.
